# Section 2: ancestral gene sets
#################################
> AncGenes

# Syntax:
#   name = all
# Function:
#   Extract the complete set of ancestral genes from the gene trees and use the requested
#   name in the rest of this configuration file.
all = all

# Syntax:
#   name = min max
#   name1,name2,...namen = min1 max1, min2 max2, ... min_n max_n
# Function:
#   Given the complete set defined above, and located in 'ancGenes/all/',
#   this tells AGORA to launch the size filter program, which keeps the families where at least min% of the species are present, and the size does not exceed max%
#   The result of the filter is a set of "constrained" ancestral genes, further refered in this configuration file by 'name'
# Note:
#   It is more efficient to bundle all filters in the same line
#   See examples in agora-vertebrates.ini and agora-multi-constrained.ini



# Section 3: pairwise comparisons
##################################
> Pairwise

# Syntax:
#   name = method arg1 arg2 ... argn
# Function:
#   Tells AGORA to launch the pairwise program named 'method' with arguments (arg1 arg2 ... argn), using the ancestral gene set 'name'
# Supported methods:
#   conservedPairs: List of conserved pairs

all = conservedPairs


# Section 4: integration
#########################
> Integration

# Syntax:
#   [custom_name] method arg1 arg2 ... argn (input_pairwise) > {output_integration_alias} < {input_integration_alias}
# Function:
#   Tells AGORA to launch the integration program named 'method' with arguments (arg1 arg2 ... argn), using the result of the pairwise comparison 'input_pairwise'
#   The list of integrations must begin with a method that produces ancestral blocks from scratch (such as 'denovo').
#   Subsequents methods should act like filters, reading ancestral blocks (by default, the results of the previous method) and producing new ones.
#   A method can use a specific method as input with the '< {input_integration_alias}' directive, with the alias defined by '> {output_integration_alias}'
# Supported methods:
#   denovo
#   fillin
#   fusion
#   insertion
#   scaffolds
#   copy
# Directory names:
#   Directory names are generated by concatening the integration names and the input data names
#     -> denovo-all.fillin-all.fusion-all
#   They can be customized with the [custom_name] directive
#   '[custom] fillin' tells to use 'custom' instead of the integration name ('fillin')
#     -> denovo-all.custom-all.fusion-all
#   '[custom/] fillin' tells to use 'custom' instead of the integration name ('fillin'), without adding the input data name
#     -> denovo-all.custom.fusion-all
#   '[/custom] fillin' tells to start a new directory name with 'custom'
#     -> custom-all.fusion-all
#   '[/custom/] fillin' tells to start a new directory name with 'custom', without adding the input data name
#     -> custom.fusion-all
# Ancestral species list:
#   Anc: all the ancestors below Anc (included)
#   =Anc: Anc (only)
#   \Anc: all the ancestors above Anc (included)
#   /Anc: all the outgroup ancestors of Anc (included)
#   These can be concatenated with ',', and negated with '_'
#   If none given, AGORA will use the same list as the previous step, starting with the entire species-tree
